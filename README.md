# homeassistant-laseregg

This a component for laseregg to be adapted to homeassistant.

Cause: 

The original device of laseregg v1 donot provied the ability to be 
controlled via home-assistant nor the Apple HomeKit connection.

The homebridge plugin has been created to provide Apple homekit 
capability, however the best practice is  connect all the devices
via home-assistant, for a centeralize control, and provie a 
portal to homekit via homebridge-homeassistant.



本代码由用于在homeassitant 上提供对第一代镭豆设备(laser egg)的支持.
laser egg是一个激光计数为基础的空气粒子计数器，用于采样PM2.5/PM10
指数。
